# tic-tac-toe
A simple tic tac toe app, developed with Reactjs.

I started by taking the code from the example in the official react [documentation](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#overview), and i added the option of playing against a minimax algorithm that a took from this article [How to make your Tic Tac Toe game unbeatable by using the minimax algorithm](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-your-tic-tac-toe-game-unbeatable-by-using-the-minimax-algorithm-9d690bad4b37), then i adjusted it so the algorithm would choose different moves even if the player keep making the same move (as shown in the image below).
